# css-filter
A simple web project which uses the power of css filter property and pure vanilla javascript to create your own image editor.
This app includes pre-set filter styles from [Instagram.css v0.1.4](github.com/picturepan2/instagram.css), coupled with the ability to 
customize your own filter to apply to an image.
